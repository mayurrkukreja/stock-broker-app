This document outlines the implementation details for a full-stack web application showcasing real-time stock price updates, powered by React and Node.js with Polygon.io API integration.

### Backend (Node.js):

1. Fetching and Storing Top Stocks:

Use the Polygon.io API to fetch the list of top 20 stocks and their opening prices.
Generate a unique refreshInterval (between 1-5 seconds) for each stock using a random number generator.
Store this data (including tickers, open prices, and refresh intervals) in a file (e.g., JSON) or a lightweight database like Redis for faster access and persistence.
Real-time Price Updates:

2. Implement a background process (e.g., using scheduled tasks) that runs at regular intervals (e.g., every second).
Within this process, iterate over the stored list of stocks.
For each stock, check if its current time aligns with its assigned refreshInterval.
If yes, use the Polygon.io API again to fetch the latest price for the specific stock.
Update the stored price information in the file/database.
Websocket API:

3. Utilize a node.js websocket library like socket.io to set up a websocket server.
Clients (frontend) can connect to this server and subscribe to specific stock updates by providing their IDs.
When a stock's price gets updated in the background process, broadcast the new price information through the websocket to all clients subscribed to that stock.
Frontend (React):

### User Interface:

1. Render an input field to accept user input for the number of stocks (n, where n <= 20).
Implement input validation to ensure valid non-zero integers within the acceptable range.
Sending Stock IDs:

2. Once the user submits the chosen number of stocks (n), extract the chosen stock IDs from the stored data based on the user's input (n).
Utilize the websocket connection established with the backend API to send these chosen stock IDs for subscription.
Receiving and Displaying Updates:

3. Implement websocket message listeners on the React side.
Update the UI dynamically as new price updates for the subscribed stocks are received through the websocket connection.
Consider using components for each stock to handle individual updates and present them clearly on the UI.
Additional Considerations:

### Edge Cases:

1. Handle situations where the Polygon.io API returns errors or is unavailable. Implement retry logic or display informative messages to the user.
Consider gracefully handling scenarios where the user chooses more stocks than allowed or invalid input is provided.
Error Handling:

2. Implement error handling mechanisms for both backend and frontend operations. Log errors and display user-friendly messages whenever issues arise.
Scalability:

3. Consider the potential to scale the application to handle more concurrent users and requests. Utilize efficient data structures and libraries for optimal performance.
UI:

4. Design a clean and intuitive user interface that effectively displays the stock information with real-time updates. Utilize modern UI libraries and best practices for a pleasant user experience.
