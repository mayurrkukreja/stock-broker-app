Full Stack Developer Assignment:
Build a web application on react with your choice of backend (preferably nodejs or golang). You should be using the polygon free tier API for fetching all the required data (polygon.io)

The overall task is to display a stocks list and their live price updates. The task is divided into sub tasks mentioned below:

Backend
1. Get the list of top 20 stocks along with their open price from polygon API and assign them a "refreshInterval" lying between 1-5 secs unique for each stock. Store this in a file in the backend.

2. The prices of each of these stocks should be updated with a random value every refreshInterval seconds, make sure that each stock is to be updated at it's own interval.

3. Expose a websocket API which broadcasts the the price of a stock as and when refreshed.

Frontend
1. Take an integer n from the user as an input, not more than 20.

2. Fetch n stocks from the backend and send the ids of these stocks into the websocket connection to subscribe to these updates.

3. Display the data received from websocket on the frontend as and when receieved.

You will be evaluated based on the structuring, readability, handling of edge cases, error handling, scalability, UI.
